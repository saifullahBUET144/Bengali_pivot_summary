This repository contains the codes and files from the thesis titled "Leveraging Pivoting Techniques for Summarization in
Low-Resource Languages: Insights from Bangla".

Bangla is the 7th most spoken language globally, with over 230 million speakers. Thus,
developing NLP tools and resources for Bangla can facilitate communication, educa-
tion, and access to information for millions of people worldwide. As a low-resource lan-
guage in terms of available datasets and NLP technologies, research in Bangla NLP
can address the gap in linguistic resources and technologies for under-resourced lan-
guages, promoting linguistic diversity and inclusivity in the digital era. Additionally, NLP
research for Bangla can enhance machine translation, text summarizing, sentiment
analysis, and other NLP tasks, enabling better access to Bangla content on the inter-
net and improving user experiences for Bangla speakers. In the specific case of text
summarizing, the lack of high-quality datasets or in reality, any mentionable datasets at
all, is causing stagnation in many sectors of research and applications such as summa-
rizing videos and news articles for better comprehension, where such resources could
have been valuable. Overall, investing in NLP research for Bangla language not only
serves the needs of its vast speaker population but also contributes to the advancement
of NLP technologies for diverse linguistic contexts globally (book summary, exam pa-
per and literature evaluation).

But the synthesizing of text summarizing data by human endeavour is time-consuming
and in many countries in the world, the resources necessary for such a task is often
difficult to manage. Therefore, if generation of synthetic dataset through pivoting ap-
proach is proven to be viable, the task of synthesizing datasets for text summarizing
would become much less time consuming and less resource-intensive.
